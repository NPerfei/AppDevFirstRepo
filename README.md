# AppDevFirstRepo
A repository made for my AppDev subject.

## Why is it public?
So that the subject instructor can easily access the repository.

## Why use git & GitHub?
Because it makes tracking changes easier, which may seem like a hassle at first, but will pay off once a *codebase* starts growing larger. It also makes **collaboration** easier.
